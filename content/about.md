### Inspiration
The authors of this study have been teaching biblical parenting to parents and couples for many years now. This site is a new way to share that teaching with more people who can find it helpful.

### Sources
This course's material is based on:
- *The Bible*
- *Growing Kids God’s Way* by Gary & Anne Marie Ezzo
- *Shepherding a Child’s Heart* by Ted Tripp
- *The Key to Your Child’s Heart* by Gary Smalley
- *Dare to Discipline* & *Bringing Up Boys* by James Dobson

### The Authors
The lessons on Parenting Biblically were compiled by Frank and Elayne Saucier, who are medical professionals and parents in the Southeastern USA. They are dedicated to following scripture wherever it leads, and they have four grown-up children, one of whom created this site based on their study notes.
